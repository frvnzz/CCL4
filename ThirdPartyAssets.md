### How to Import
1. Add the Assets listed above to your Unity Account  
2. Open the Project  
3. Go to **Window > Package Manager** and click **My Assets**  
4. Download and import each asset into the project. Ensure the assets are imported into the prepared folder (`Assets/ThirdPartyAssets`) to maintain organization.  
   - **Note:** This folder structure is also important for ensuring the assets are properly excluded from version control. (see `UnityProject/.gitignore`)
5. With some of the assets, it may be necessary to use the **Render Pipeline Converter** to convert the assets to the project's render pipeline (e.g., URP or HDRP). To access the converter, go to **Window > Rendering > Render Pipeline Converter**.
